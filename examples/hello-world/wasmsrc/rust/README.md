# Hello World!

## Overview

This is a tutorial for compiling an Rust file into an WebAssembly module.

## Setup

### Prerequisite

#### The Rust toolchain

You will need the standard Rust toolchain, including rustup, rustc, and cargo.

[Follow these instructions to install the Rust toolchain.][1]

The Rust and WebAssembly experience is riding the Rust release trains to stable! That means we don't require any experimental feature flags. However, we do require Rust 1.30 or newer.

#### `wasm-pack`

wasm-pack is your one-stop shop for building, testing, and publishing Rust-generated WebAssembly.

Get [`wasm-pack`][2] here!

> If you are a Microsoft Windows 10 user, it is highly recommended to install [WSL2][3], everything will be much smoother!

#### [ZKC-SDK][4]

```shell
npm install zkc-sdk
```

### Implementation

1.  Initialize the project:

```shell
cargo init
```

2.  Edit our new Cargo.toml to implement wasm-pack

```toml
[package]
name = "hello-world"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name <your@email>"]
edition = "2021"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"
```

3.  Lastly, let's take a quick peek inside at the src/ directory. Since we are building a library (lib) to be used by a larger application, we need to rename the src/main.rs to src/lib.rs. Go ahead and do that now before moving forward.

Let's go ahead and replace src/lib.rs with the required use call as mentioned in the quickstart, as well as our add function:

```rs
// The wasm-pack uses wasm-bindgen to build and generate JavaScript binding file.
// Import the wasm-bindgen crate.
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

// Our Add function
// wasm-pack requires "exported" functions
// to include #[wasm_bindgen]
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    return a + b;
}
```

4.  Compile that into a wasm module which will output a `hello-world.wasm` :

```shell
wasm-pack build --target web
```

This will output a `pkg/` directory containing our wasm module, wrapped in a js object.
