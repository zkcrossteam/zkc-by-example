# ZKC-by-example

> ZKC-by-example contains some examples demonstrating how to create a ZKCross wasm application and deploy the proof to the chain with [ZKC-SDK][1].

## Example list

1.  **Hello World**

    To get started, we'll compile TypeScript/C/Rust into WebAssembly and initialize it with the ZKC SDK. Then, we can call the methods exported from WebAssembly to obtain a lucky number.

2.  **ZK Hello World**

    Basics of zkWasm-C. In this example, we'll add zkWasm-C as a submodule, compile it, and call its methods. Afterwards, we'll prove our inputs and deploy the proof to the chain with ZKC SDK.

3.  **Dice Game**

    For a more advanced challenge, we'll create a complete ZKCross web application, which involves compiling and running the wasm file, creating and deploying the wasm application, and submitting the proof for deployment on the chain.

## Technology Stack

- **Front end**

  - Language: [TypeScript v5][2]
  - Component engine: [React v18][3]
  - CSS utility class: [Bootstrap v5][4]
  - Package management tool: [pnpm][5]
  - CI / CD: [GitHub Actions][6] + [Vercel][7]

- **WASM**

  - Language: [C][8]
  - Compilation tool: [Clang][9]

## How To Run This Repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/zkcrossteam/ZKC-by-example.git
```

## How to compile

### Frontend

If you want to launch and preview any of the examples, you can execute the following command.

> [Node.js][10] and [pnpm][11] are required.

```shell
pnpm i

# For Hello World example
pnpm hello-world

# For ZK Hello World example
pnpm zk-hello-world

# For Dice Game example
pnpm dice-game
```

### WASM

#### zkWasm-C

First, you need to add the C SDK repository to the project, either directly in the project root folder by cloning it, or you can add the SDK repository as a Git submodule to the project.

If you want to clone the repository, execute the following command:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:zkcrossteam/zkWasm-C.git
```

If you want to add submodules, execute the following command:

```shell
git submodule add git@github.com:zkcrossteam/zkWasm-C.git
```
