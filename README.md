# ZKC-by-example

> ZKC-by-example contains some examples showing how to create a ZKCross wasm application and deploy the proof to the chain with [ZKC-SDK][1].

## Example list

1.  hello world Getting started with wasm, we will compile Typescript/C/Rust to WebAssembly and initialize it with the ZKC sdk, and then we are able to call the method exported from WebAssembly to get a lucky number.
2.  ZK hello world zkWASM-C basics, in this example, we will add zkWasm-C as a submodule, compile and call the methods in zkWasm-C, finally, we will prove our inputs and deploy the proof onto the chain with ZKC SDK
3.  dice game For an advanced challenge, we will create a complete ZKCross web application which includes compiling and running the wasm file, creating and deploying the wasm application, and finally submitting proof and deploy it onto the chain.

## How To Run This Repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/zkcrossteam/ZKC-by-example.git
```

## How to compile

### Frontend

If you want to launch and preview any of example, you can execute the following command

> [Node.js][10] and [pnpm][11] is required.

```shell
pnpm i

# For hello world example
pnpm hello-world
# For zk hello world example
pnpm zk-hello-world
# For dice game example
pnpm dice-game
```

### WASM

#### zkWasm-C

First, you need to add the C SDK repository to the project, either directly in the project root folder by cloning it, or you can add the SDK repository as a Git submodule to the project.

If you want to clone the repository, execute the following command:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:zkcrossteam/zkWasm-C.git
```

If you want to add submodules, execute the following command:

```shell
git submodule add git@github.com:zkcrossteam/zkWasm-C.git
```
